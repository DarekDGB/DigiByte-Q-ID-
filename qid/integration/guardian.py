Guardian rules integration helpers for Q-ID.

This module will define how Q-ID trust levels and signals can be used by
a rules engine, for example:
- require Q-ID level >= 2 for high-value transactions
- block actions from untrusted devices
- require recent Q-ID login before critical operations

Currently this contains only a placeholder.
